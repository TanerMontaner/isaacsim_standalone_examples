# Isaac Sim Standalone Examples

NVIDIA’s `standalone_examples` scripts, freed from the giant zip file. Pure Python for Isaac Sim users, just code. Pulled from version 4.5.0.

## Usage
- Requires Isaac Sim (e.g., `pip install isaacsim`).
- Run: `python api/omni.isaac.core/add_cubes.py`.

## Why?
Because when installing IsaacSim/IsaacLab via pip, it is difficult to access the examples.
Additionally, LLM coding agents struggle to work with IsaacSim.
